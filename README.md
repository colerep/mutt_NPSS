**mutt_NPSS: NPSS Model for Simulating a Sub-Scale Multiphase CO2 Test Loop** 

This repository contains an NPSS model for simulating a closed-cycle, sub-scale test loop designed for multiphase flow with carbon dioxide (CO2) as the working fluid.  The model incorporates the REFPROP thermodynamic package for accurate property calculations and allows the investigation of component behavior within the loop.
